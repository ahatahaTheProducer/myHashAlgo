# myHashAlgo
In this project we are asked to implement our own hashing algorithm

I know that it is really a redundant algorithm that i implemented, but in a limited time this was what i could do.
It can handle most cases, yet the algorithm is not made to satisfy all needs of a hashing algorithm. The description is in the cmpe250_project2.pdf file. If you see any mistake, any help is appriciated.

Thanks :)
