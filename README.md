# myHashAlgo
In this project we are asked to implement our own hashing algorithm

I know that it is really a redundant algorithm that i implemented, but in a limited time this was what i could do.
It can handle most cases, yet the algorithm is not made to satisfy all needs of a hashing algorithm. The description is in the documentation.pdf file. If you see any mistake, any help is appriciated.

The sample.zip file contains sample initial states, sample input files and expected outputs along my outputs. In order to run the program you need to extract the files and use them as inputs.

Thanks :)
